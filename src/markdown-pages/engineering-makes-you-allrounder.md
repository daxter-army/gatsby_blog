>* Awaking all night,<br/>
>* Learning from youtube tutorials,<br/>
>* Late night outing with firends,<br/>
>* Giving Exams without studying,<br/>
>* Craving at midnight for Maggie,<br/>
>* Bunking classes and <br/>
>* what not an Engineer do, during his/her Engineering.

>* It's not only a journey of 4 years of study but also gives experience of working in situations totally against us. Crazy things happen to people like falling for someone in love, or getting compartments in subjects, but these are normal things in an Engineering college & although incidents like these have some teachings for you that prove to be useful for your further life, if we look at the brighter side ðŸ˜‚.

>* After having placed, very few engineers are there who do what they have studied in those 4 years. Most of the engineers survive just because what they learnt except studies during engineering which makes every engineer to withstand with any kind of situation or impediments coming in his/her path. This is the reason due to which a Mech Engg gets a job in IT Sector. Engineers grow up to be actors, writers, cricketers, bussiness heads, IPS, IAS and what not.
