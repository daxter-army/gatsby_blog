* So I should clear this here, I am not on any social media platform.

**PROS**
> * You can connect with your distant friends,<br/>
> * Can be used as a source of Crowdfunding<br/>
> * It allows for quick diffusion of public health & safety info during crisis events<br/>
> * Social media can help disarm social stigmas like anxiety or depression<br/>
> * Professional networking sites like LinkedIn greatly assists companies to find personnel and job seekers to find work<br/>
> * Employers can judge the candidates based upon their social media presence and posts<br/>

**CONS**
> * Gigantic source of DISTRACTIONS<br/>
> * Cyber bullying and harrassing<br/>
> * Social media use is associated with personality and brain disorders<br/>
> * Social media is also a source of Negativity, advertisements try to manipulate you without you even knowing<br/>
> * People are trying to fake themselves, impress others by showing off, even by using fake attributes<br/>
> * The scenario of Followers and Following traps you and affects you in a great way<br/>

* Clinical Psychologists and the author of *The Teen Girl's Survival Guide*, Dr. Lucie Hemmen, writes *"Most people experience huge benefits from taking a social media break. There is a way in which cultivating and maintaining your online identity can replace an authentic connection to your true self. The more grounded you are in your authentic value as a human being, the less likely you are to be a heavy user of social media and also to be negatively affected by it"*

* So it's basically upto you, that how you use social media platforms, if you use it in a positive and a free way, then there is no harm in using it, but If you struggle with feelings of insecurity and find yourself putting a lot of time and effort into portraying yourself a particular way on social media, then you are more vulnerable and would benefit profoundly from regular breaks. You will have the space needed to move toward your true self.
